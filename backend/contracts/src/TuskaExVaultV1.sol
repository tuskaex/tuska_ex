/**
 * @title TuskaExVaultV1
 * @notice Custody vault for TuskaEx — holds a single ERC20 stablecoin
 *         (USDT in production) on behalf of all platform users.
 *
 * Design intent (Phase 1):
 *   • Aggregate custody only — no per-user balances on-chain. The
 *     backend ledger (PostgreSQL) is authoritative for what each user
 *     can withdraw. The vault simply holds the pooled funds and
 *     emits Deposit / Withdraw events the verifier engine consumes
 *     to keep the off-chain ledger in sync.
 *   • Withdrawals are role-gated and idempotent — every approved
 *     withdrawal carries a backend-generated UUID (`approvalId`); a
 *     re-broadcast of the same tx after one was already processed is
 *     blocked at the contract level via `usedApprovalIds`.
 *   • Multi-sig admin — the multi-sig holds DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE,
 *     WITHDRAWER_ROLE, and PAUSER_ROLE. No single key can drain.
 *   • Non-upgradeable — bug fixes ship as a new contract + DB
 *     migration, not as a proxy upgrade. Smaller audit surface,
 *     no admin-proxy compromise risk.
 *
 * What this contract intentionally does NOT do:
 *   • per-user balance accounting
 *   • orderbook / matching / leverage
 *   • bridges / cross-chain
 *   • protocol-token, staking, referral mechanics
 *
 * Reference: docs/vault-phase1-spec.md
