"""Add is_testnet flag and approval_id idempotency key for vault integration.

Two additive changes preparing the gateway for the BSC-testnet vault
(commit `feat(contracts): TuskaExVaultV1 + Foundry repo`):

1. `admin_deposit_wallets.is_testnet` BOOLEAN — distinguishes a
   testnet deposit wallet from a mainnet one. Same `network` slug
   ('bsc' / 'eth' / 'tron') stays canonical; the boolean disambiguates
   environment. Default false so existing rows are unchanged.

2. `withdrawals.approval_id` VARCHAR(66) UNIQUE — stores the
   bytes32 idempotency key the backend generates per approved
   withdrawal. The vault contract refuses any `withdraw()` call
   carrying an approvalId already seen on-chain; the DB column lets
   the verifier match the `Withdraw` event back to a local row.

Both columns nullable / defaulted so:
  • the migration does not require any data backfill,
  • existing flows (plain USDT transfers to admin wallet) keep
    working unchanged when contract_address IS NULL,
  • the new vault path activates only on rows where
    contract_address IS NOT NULL.
