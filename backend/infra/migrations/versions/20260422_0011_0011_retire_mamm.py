"""Retire the legacy 'mamm' master_type.

MAM Trading now lives under /social as the signal_provider master type;
the old pooled/individual MAM that shared /pamm with PAMM has been dropped.
This migration removes any remaining MAMM master_accounts and their
dependents so the /pamm Browse list stops showing them.
