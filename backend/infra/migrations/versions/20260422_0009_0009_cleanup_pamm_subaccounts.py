"""Cleanup existing PAMM investor sub-accounts (pre-pool-model data).

PAMM is being reworked as a true pooled fund: investors no longer get a
dedicated trading account, they just hold a share of the master's pool.
This migration:
  1. For each active PAMM allocation that has an investor_account_id:
     - Closes any open positions on that investor sub-account (at open_price,
       no P&L — the investor's pool share is tracked via master's balance
       going forward)
     - Returns the sub-account's balance to the investor's main wallet
     - Nulls out allocation.investor_account_id
     - Marks the sub-account inactive
  2. MAM allocations are left untouched.
