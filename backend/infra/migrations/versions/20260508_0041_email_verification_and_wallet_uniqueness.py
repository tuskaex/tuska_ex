"""Email verification + wallet uniqueness for the strict onboarding rule.

Two intertwined goals:

1. Every account must have exactly **one verified email**:
   - Adds users.email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
   - Adds users.email_verified_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL
   - Backfills email_verified = TRUE for accounts created via Google
     sign-in (Google verifies the address upstream, no point asking
     them to verify again).
   - Adds the email_otp_codes table that powers the
     /auth/email/start-verification + /auth/email/verify-otp flow.

2. Every account must have at most **one linked wallet**, and any given
   wallet may be linked to at most **one account at a time**:
   - The User model already has a single wallet_address column
     (so "one account = one wallet" is a structural constraint).
   - Adds a partial UNIQUE index on LOWER(wallet_address) WHERE
     wallet_address IS NOT NULL so racing link attempts can't both
     succeed.

Backwards-compatible. Existing rows with no wallet stay as-is. Existing
sessions are unaffected — onboarding_complete is computed at /auth/me
time, so the gate kicks in on the next request without needing a
forced logout.
