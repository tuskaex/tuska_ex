"""De-duplicate active copy_trades + add partial unique index.

Gateway runs with --workers 2 in production; each worker was independently
running copy_engine, so every master trade was being mirrored twice per
follower. This migration:

  1. Finds duplicate open CopyTrade rows with the same
     (master_position_id, investor_allocation_id) — keeps the oldest,
     closes the rest at their open price (zero P&L) so follower books
     reconcile cleanly.
  2. Adds a partial unique index so the DB rejects any future attempt
     to insert a second active mirror for the same (master_pos, alloc).
