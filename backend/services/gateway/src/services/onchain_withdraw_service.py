"""Decentralized USDT withdrawal flow.

Mirrors `onchain_deposit_service.py` for the payout direction:

  Trader picks chain (eth/bsc/tron) + types their USDT destination + USD
  amount → server validates the address format for the chosen chain,
  debits main_wallet_balance immediately (frozen for review), inserts a
  `withdrawals` row with status='pending'. Admin reviews on the back
  office, signs the on-chain transfer from the admin deposit wallet,
  pastes the resulting tx hash; `chain_verifier_engine` confirms the
  transfer landed and flips the row to 'paid'. Reject-path refunds the
  debit.

The destination is whatever the user typed; no wallet-connect required.
We do basic format validation per chain so admin doesn't have to
manually sanity-check every payout address.
