"""Copy Trade Engine — Replicates master trades to investor sub-accounts.

Architecture:
- Manager trades one master TradingAccount; positions live as Position rows.
- This engine polls ~every 2s, diffs master open positions vs in-memory snapshot,
  opens/closes child positions on each linked investor account.
- Lot scaling is driven by InvestorAllocation.copy_type (signal | pamm | mam), not mixed.
- Master positions are never modified by this engine.

Performance fee runs on close only (see _close_copy).
