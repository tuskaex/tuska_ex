"""Overnight leverage fee engine.

Per Trading_Mechanism.docx:
  Fully funded (leverage = 1)  → no overnight fee.
  Leveraged trades             → 0.01% per day on the borrowed portion only.
  Borrowed portion             = notional × (L − 1) / L
  Daily charge                 = borrowed_portion × 0.0001

Skipped:
  - swap_free instruments (InstrumentConfig.swap_free = TRUE)
  - swap_free account groups (Islamic; AccountGroup.swap_free = TRUE)
  - leverage <= 1 (no borrowed portion)

Idempotency: each position has positions.last_swap_at; the engine charges
when (now - last_swap_at) >= 24h, and only one charge fires per 24h window
even if the engine ticks more often.
