[Setup]
; A FRESH AppId, unlike the Bull4x → SwissCresta renames this build was forked
; from. Those were renames of one product, so they kept the original AppId to
; upgrade in place. TuskaEx is a different platform: reusing that AppId would
; make this installer overwrite an existing SwissCresta install and take over
; its Apps & features entry. Once published, do not change it again — that is
; what lets a later version upgrade this one.

; ── Installing over a RUNNING terminal ───────────────────────────────
; Symptom this fixes:
;     resources\icudtl.dat
;     DeleteFile failed; code 32.
;     The process cannot access the file because it is being used by
;     another process.
;
; Inno already asks Restart Manager to close whatever holds the files it
; is about to replace, but CloseApplicationsFilter defaults to
; *.exe,*.dll,*.chm — and the files QtWebEngine keeps mapped are none of
; those. icudtl.dat, qtwebengine_resources*.pak and v8_context_snapshot.bin
; were never registered, so nothing was detected, the install ran, and it
; died partway through on the first locked one. Widening the filter to
; every file is what actually makes the detection cover them. It costs a
; slower "Preparing to install" scan; a half-installed terminal costs more.
CloseApplications=yes
CloseApplicationsFilter=*.*
; Don't relaunch what we closed — [Run] below already offers to start it,
; and reopening it silently mid-install races the file copy.
RestartApplications=no
; Belt and braces: the app holds this mutex while it runs (see src/main.cpp),
; so Setup can say "close TuskaEx Terminal" up front instead of relying on
; Restart Manager alone. Renaming it breaks that detection on installed
; versions, so leave it alone.

; ignoreversion is NOT optional here.
;
; Inno's default for a file carrying version info is to replace it only when
; the incoming version is HIGHER. terminal.exe declares its version from
; resources/app.rc, and that had been left at 1.0.1 across builds — so an
; upgrade compared 1.0.1 against 1.0.1, decided there was nothing to do, and
; skipped the executable. Setup still wrote the uninstaller and stamped
; DisplayVersion=1.0.2 into Apps & features, which is the worst possible
; outcome: the machine reports 1.0.2 while running the older binary, and the
; only symptom is "my changes aren't there".
;
; app.rc is bumped alongside AppVersion now, but this flag is the belt to that
; brace — a build where someone forgets to bump still ships, because the file
; is replaced on every install regardless of what its version claims.
