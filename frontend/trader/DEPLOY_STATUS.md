| ID | Finding | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 M1 / P5 MD1 | Stale WALLETCONNECT in Dockerfile | ✅ Fixed | ARG + ENV removed |
| P1 M2 | CSP nonce for inline scripts | ⏸️ Deferred | CSP enforcement deferred (no observability per user choice) |
| P1 M3 | postcss < 8.5.10 CVE | ⚠️ Risk-Accepted | Next.js bundles; auto-fix breaks app; no user input flows to PostCSS |
| P1 M4 | No rate limiting | ✅ **Fixed (NEW)** | Middleware rate limiter on 6 auth endpoints (login/register/reset/email-otp/google) |
| P1 M5 | CORS blind forwarding | ✅ Fixed | `sanitizeCorsHeaders()` strips Allow-Credentials when origin is `*` |
| P2 M1 | 8 suspected-unused deps | ✅ Fixed | 6 confirmed + removed (`@react-three/fiber`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `class-variance-authority`, `qrcode.react`, `react-countup`, `react-intersection-observer`) |
| P2 M2 | 4 devDep false positives | ✓ Acknowledged | depcheck false positives — no action |
| P2 M3 | auth login/register duplicate | ⏸️ Deferred | Refactor scope; Batch H |
| P2 M4 | CSS file dups | ✅ Verified intentional | Light/dark theme variable blocks — not duplication, by design |
| P2 M5 | landing/components orphans (HeroOverlay/PlatformCard/TradingPageTemplate) | ✅ Fixed | HeroOverlay + PlatformCard deleted; TradingPageTemplate restored (4 active consumers) |
| P2 M6 | landing showcase components | ✅ Fixed | shared/ + features/ trees purged in Batch H partial |

| P3 LA3 | middleware.ts location | ✓ Already correct |
| P4 LQ1 | Zero @ts-ignore | ✓ Already passing |
| P4 LQ2 | 4 non-null assertions only | ✓ Already passing (now more due to noUncheckedIndexedAccess fixes — all justified) |
| P4 LQ3 | 57 a11y attrs | 🟡 Partial — jsx-a11y plugin surfaces issues as warnings; axe-core runtime needs dev server |
| P5 LD1 | NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED inconsistency | ⚠️ Risk-Accepted — cosmetic |
| P5 LD2 | No CI workflow | ✅ Fixed — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` extended with lint + build gates |

### Score

**Fixed: 41 / Partial: 4 / Deferred: 12 / Risk-Accepted: 3 / Passing: 5**
Excluding monitoring (Sentry/CSP enforcement intentionally skipped per user choice): **41 of 49 actionable findings = 84% closed**.

## 2. Environment Variables Required

### Server-side (set in Docker/host env, NOT committed)

```bash
# Internal gateway URL — REQUIRED
TRADER_API_PROXY_TARGET=http://gateway:8000

# Standalone build output — set automatically in Dockerfile builder stage
NEXT_OUTPUT_STANDALONE=true

# Telemetry off in prod — set automatically in Dockerfile
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

### Client-side (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, baked into JS bundle at build time)

```bash
# Cache buster — set to commit SHA via --build-arg
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

# Host split — BOTH required, middleware silently no-ops if either is empty
NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETING_HOST=tuskaex.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_TRADE_HOST=trade.tuskaex.com

# Google OAuth client ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
```

### Intentionally NOT set in production
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` — leave empty; auto-detects `wss://<host>/ws/prices`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_ORIGIN` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` — leave empty; same-origin proxy is preferred
- `SENTRY_DSN` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` — Sentry intentionally skipped per user choice

## 3. Manual Smoke Test Checklist

Run AGAINST a prod-built container before promoting to live.

### Build verification (CI also runs these)
- [ ] `cd fxartha/frontend/trader && rm -rf .next && npm run build` → exit 0, 65 routes
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors
- [ ] `docker build -t tuskaex-trader-test .` → completes
- [ ] `docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env.production tuskaex-trader-test` → container starts, no startup errors

### Routes (light marketing theme)
- [ ] `/` — home page, white background, ticker tape at bottom, navbar links work
- [ ] `/about` — light, branded layout
- [ ] `/contact` — light, contact form renders
- [ ] `/platforms` — light, no console errors
- [ ] `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/risk`, `/white-label` — light, no errors
- [ ] `/how-it-works` — light (recently migrated from --fx-* tokens)
- [ ] `/platforms/insurance` — light (recently migrated)

### Routes (dark trader/sub-marketing theme)
- [ ] `/trading/overview`, `/protocol`, `/insurance/overview` — dark chrome, legacy navbar
- [ ] `/platforms/copy-trading`, `/platforms/web`, `/platforms/prop-trading`, `/platforms/ib-management`, `/platforms/super-admin` — dark
- [ ] `/company/why-tuskaex` — dark
- [ ] `/accounts/standard`, `/accounts/pro`, `/accounts/demo` — dark

### Authentication flows (CRITICAL — proxy + rate limiter coverage)
- [ ] `/auth/login` — sign in with password works → redirects to `/dashboard`
- [ ] `/auth/login` — sign in with Google OAuth works → redirects to `/accounts`
- [ ] `/auth/register` — full signup flow → account created, redirects appropriately
- [ ] `/auth/reset-password` — request reset → email delivered
- [ ] Rate-limit test: hit `/api/v1/auth/login` 6 times in 60s → 6th returns 429 with `Retry-After` header
- [ ] Rate-limit test: hit `/api/v1/auth/register` 4 times in 60s → 4th returns 429

### Authenticated app
- [ ] `/dashboard` — banner carousel renders (next/image), account stats load
- [ ] `/wallet` — deposit/withdraw forms render
- [ ] `/wallet` — deposit multipart upload succeeds (proxy path)
- [ ] `/wallet` — withdraw multipart succeeds
- [ ] `/kyc` — document upload (multipart through proxy) succeeds
- [ ] `/trading/terminal` — chart loads, order panel opens, position open/close works
- [ ] `/portfolio` — positions list loads
- [ ] `/transactions` — history loads, filters work
- [ ] `/social` — followers/providers load

### Error boundaries + 404
- [ ] `/this-route-does-not-exist` — branded dark 404 renders
- [ ] `/platforms/this-does-not-exist` — branded light 404 (marketing variant) renders
- [ ] Force an error in a trader page (dev only) — error.tsx renders with "Try again" + "Dashboard" CTAs

### SEO
- [ ] `curl https://<host>/robots.txt` → 200, allows `/`, disallows `/dashboard`, `/wallet`, etc.
- [ ] `curl https://<host>/sitemap.xml` → 200, valid XML, includes 26 marketing URLs
- [ ] `curl https://<host>/manifest.webmanifest` → 200, valid JSON
- [ ] View page source on `/dashboard` — `<title>Dashboard — TuskaEx</title>` (not generic)
- [ ] View page source on `/wallet` — title is "Wallet — TuskaEx"

### Security headers (curl from outside the box)
- [ ] `curl -I https://<host>/` shows: `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Permissions-Policy: ...`, `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: ...`

### Accessibility
- [ ] Pinch-zoom works on mobile Safari (viewport WCAG fix)
- [ ] Keyboard tab through `/auth/login` form — focus rings visible

## 4. Post-Deploy Backlog

Prioritized for first 2 weeks post-launch.

### Week 1 (operational essentials)
| Priority | Item | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| HIGH | Lock down `images.remotePatterns` to actual CDN hosts (CD3) — replace wildcard | ~15 min once host list known |
| MED | Wire monitoring of choice (Sentry / DataDog / Logflare) — IF you change your mind | ~1 hr |
| MED | If monitoring wired: promote CSP from Report-Only → enforced after 1 week of clean logs | ~5 min |
| MED | Generate `openapi.json` from backend and run Batch M (HQ1) — convert ~60 `any` types | ~2 hrs |

### Weeks 2–4 (code quality sprint)
| Priority | Item | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| MED | **Batch H — architecture refactor**: move `components/<feature>/*` → `features/<feature>/components/*`; move `landing/components/*` → `features/marketing/components/*`; move `landing/pages/*` → `features/marketing/sections/*`; remove `react-router-dom` shim | 3–5 days |
| MED | MA2 — convert ~100 `.jsx` → `.tsx` files (post Batch H) | 1–2 days |
| LOW | MQ1 — per-page audit of remaining `'use client'` candidates after Batch H stabilizes | per-file |
| LOW | MQ5 — `useMemo` / `useCallback` audit after React 19 compiler adopted | per-file |
| LOW | LQ3 — run `axe-core` baseline against staging | ~30 min |

### Backlog (no urgency)
| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Remove localStorage migration script in `app/layout.tsx` | Schedule ~2026-09 (6 months post deploy) |
| Move `data/academy.ts` → `lib/data/academy.ts` (LA1 cosmetic) | When touching academy code next |
| Move `charting/` → `features/charting/` (LA2) | Part of Batch H |

---

## 5. Rollback Plan

### Git
```bash
# Tag this audit milestone before deploy
git tag pre-deploy-audit-v1
git push origin pre-deploy-audit-v1

# Rollback target (if deploy breaks)
git log --oneline -1 main   # capture commit SHA
# Save as: ROLLBACK_SHA=abc1234

# In incident: redeploy previous Docker image (see below)
```

### Docker
- **Build tag convention:** `tuskaex-trader:<git-sha>`
- **Keep the previous image** in your registry for 30 days minimum
- **Rollback procedure:**
  1. `docker pull tuskaex-trader:<previous-sha>`
  2. Update `docker-compose.prod.yml` `image:` to previous tag
  3. `docker compose up -d trader` (or your orchestrator equivalent)
  4. Verify `/dashboard` loads + a test trade executes

### Stickiness warnings (cannot rollback cleanly)
- **HSTS** is set to `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` — browsers cache this for 1 year. Once the header ships, you cannot serve HTTP to that browser for 12 months. **Pre-deploy verification: every subdomain MUST be on HTTPS before first deploy.**
- **`localStorage` migration script** writes `tuskaex-ui` key. Users who load even once will have this set; rollback to a prior brand name would need a separate cleanup script.

---

## 6. Final GO / NO-GO

### ✅ GO with these caveats:

**Safe to ship:**
- Build, typecheck, lint all clean (with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` enforced — 178 type-safety errors eliminated this audit)
- All API proxy security guards in place (SSRF redirect validation, CORS sanitization, multipart through gateway)
- Rate limiter on 6 auth endpoints (login/register/reset/email-otp/google) at Next.js layer
- Production security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-CTO, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
- CSP in Report-Only mode (logs violations to browser console; doesn't break anything)
- Error boundaries + branded 404 / 500 at every level
- SEO files + per-page metadata on 65 routes
- Dead code purged (shared/, features/, ~40 orphan files, 6 unused deps)
- TradingView XSS escape patched
- Dockerfile correctly emits standalone bundle

**Acceptable risks (document in deploy ticket):**
- ⚠️ **No error tracking** (Sentry/etc skipped per user choice) — production failures will be invisible to operators until a user reports them. **Mitigation: aggressive manual smoke testing pre-deploy + reactive log triage post-deploy.**
- ⚠️ **Image host wildcard** (`{ hostname: '**' }`) — any HTTPS image URL passes the optimizer. Low practical risk for closed-user trading platform. Lock down within first week.
- ⚠️ **CSP not enforced** — only Report-Only. Won't block attacks until promoted. Without monitoring, can only promote based on manual browser-console inspection.
- ⚠️ **~60 `any` types remain** in API call sites — runtime safety unaffected, but TS won't catch backend response shape regressions. Closes when OpenAPI schema is available.
- ⚠️ **Single-instance rate limiter** — per-process counters. For multi-instance deploys, effective limit is N × stated value. For Docker single-container deploy: fine.

**Pre-deploy actions required:**
1. ✅ Set production env vars per section 2 above
2. ✅ Verify HTTPS is enabled on `tuskaex.com` AND `trade.tuskaex.com` (HSTS is sticky once shipped)
3. ✅ Tag the current commit (`pre-deploy-audit-v1`)
4. ✅ Run section 3 smoke-test checklist against staging
5. ✅ Have rollback Docker image ready in registry

**Deploy when all 5 above are ✅.**
